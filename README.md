# EditorLiveview

Used [Component X Software Blog Post](https://componentx.co.uk/blog/adding-trix-to-liveview) to test out if I can add
editor tools for LiveView form. Using Basecamp's [Trix](https://github.com/basecamp/trix) editor, but I think any other
editor can be used similarly.

So cool.
See how it works here in [Loom Video](https://www.loom.com/share/8d4a1b56ea76474c95bfaf177c1cfbb9)

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
